# CMSI 186 Lab 3 High Roller Starter Code

This repository contains some unfinished Java programs that you are complete.

Import this repository into a new repository of your own and write the code according to the lab [instructions](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/plab/lab/3/). Use the provided test scripts.

In your new repository, donâ€™t forget to edit this README file, as _your_ repository will certainly not contain any unfinished Java programs.

MY ACTIONS:

I imported Die.java, DiceSet.java, and HighRollerGame.java into my repository. I then cloned them into my files.

I created a Die object in Die class, filled out the roll function, return the sides and the value of a dice, and made it so the object could be written in a String.

I created a Dice Set in DiceSet class, filled in the sum() function, rollAll() function for rolling all the dice, rollINdividual(), function for getting the individual die, and returning the die in a list, and checked to see if the DiceSet matched with a generic dice set.

I finished filling out the code for HighRollerGame which allowed me to play the Dice Rolling game.
